# Law-Scout-AI

**An affordable, AI-powered legal assistant for Indian lawyers and law students.**

## The Problem
In India, solo advocates, small law firms, and students face a huge challenge. Top-tier legal technology is often too expensive and complex. This means countless hours are spent manually searching through case law (like SCC Online, Manupatra), drafting documents, and summarizing files, putting them at a disadvantage compared to larger firms.

## Our Vision
**Law-Scout-AI** aims to change that. We are building a simple, powerful, and affordable AI tool designed specifically for the Indian legal system. We want to give every lawyer and law student in India the modern tools they need to succeed.

## Key Features (What We Are Building)
*   **Document Summary:** Instantly get key points from long judgments or case files.
*   **Legal Research Assistant:** Ask questions in plain English (e.g., "What are the key Supreme Court judgments on 'basic structure doctrine'?") and get relevant case law.
*   **Document Drafting:** Get help drafting basic legal documents like notices, affidavits, or petitions.

## Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** (e.g., React, Vue.js)
*   **Backend:** (e.g., Python, Node.js)
*   **Database:** (e.g., PostgreSQL)
*   **AI/ML:** Using Large Language Models focused on Indian legal data.
